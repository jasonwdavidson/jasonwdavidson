# Hello!
### What I Do
I am a molecular biologist, and am interested in all the structures and systems which make cells work. I currently work in a clinical laboratory performing oncology testing as well as research to characterize the genetics of different tumors using molecular techniques. In my free time, I am usually reading research articles, shooting and developing film photos, and sewing. I also write scripts in Python and MATLAB to do things like posterize images, generate cross-stitch patterns, and develop tools for the laboratory.
### About Me
After growing up in Tennessee, I moved to Texas to attend UT Dallas. I completed several research experiences while working towards my BS and realized that I am most happy in a lab running experiments, problem solving, and reading publications. Since receiving my BS, I plan to continue my studies in graduate school with the ultimate goal of woring as a research scientist. When I'm not at work I love to spend time with my boyfriend and two cats, Pork Chop and Gus.
